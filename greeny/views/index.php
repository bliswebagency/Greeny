<p><strong>Howdy Partner!</strong></p>

<p>If you use a service like Beanstalk, you can call Greeny directly whenever you push an update. To do this, you'll need to point Beanstalk to your Update Path. We've included this below for you.</p>

<p><strong>Update Path</strong><br />
<pre><a href="/index.php?ACT=<?php echo $actid; ?>" target="_blank">THIS DOMAIN + /index.php?ACT=<?php echo $actid; ?></a></pre></p>

<p>If you don't use Beanstalk, you'll just need to log into your CP after you push a site live and this will trigger Greeny to do his job. You should see a status update indicating everything has worked. If you don't, check out the Accessory tab. Inside you'll see exactly what Greeny is thinking.</p>
