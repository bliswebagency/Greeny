MEET GREENY (beta)
--------------------------

Greeny was written to solve a pretty simple problem that occurs when you move an EE2 database from one server environment to another. The problem being the "absolute" upload paths are wrong and you need to manually change them. In that past people tried to get around this using relative paths... but that method really sucked as many addons didn't work well using relative paths.

With Greeny, you can use absolute paths and when you move your site, he'll update them for you AUTOMATICALLY! 

All you have to do is either:

1. Log into the CP or
2. Call the Greeny Action Path (found in the Module settings page)

It's a dead simple "set and forget" system whereby all you have to do is install it. Once it's running you'll only notice Greeny is there when he goes to work after you've moved your DB from your Local environment to Stage or Production.

HOW IT WORKS
Greeny does a couple of things. The first thing he does is remember the root server path to each of your environments. He figures these out himself and saves them all in the DB.

The next thing he does is keep an eye out for any changes to this path. If he finds one, he'll tell you about it. He'll then try to figure out if the paths you have in your Upload Preferences match up with an old environment he knows about. If they do, he'll update your paths for you so everything "just works".

Finally, Greeny can also be called directly from a service like Beanstalk. Beanstalk allows you to poll a URL before or after you deploy a site update. By putting Greeny's URL into these settings, your upload paths will be updated without you having to log into the CP.

MASSIVE DISCLAIMER
--------------------------

Greeny is a rogue ranger and abides by no mans law. Given this, you should only install this addon with the expectation that your whole site could come crashing down. Now you're shaking in your boots, download a copy and tell me about all the bugs so that we can get Greeny out there all guns blazing.

FAQ
--------------------------

Q. Why Greeny?
A. Because he looks after your environment

Q. What versions of EE2 does Greeny roll with?
A. Greeny's only been tested with EE 2.1.3 to date. We'll post a version update to confirm it also works with 2.2.1. once we've confirmed that's also working.

Q. I have a very important website which needs to stay online or the Queen of England will die. Should I install Greeny?
A. That depends... do you like the Queen? Probably best you leave this one alone for the time being.

Q. I have a small dev site that I use to play around with experimental EE2 addons. Should I install Greeny.
A. Yes. Do it now.

Q. I've found a bunch of bugs? Should I tell my mother?
A. No, tell me. Here: https://github.com/bliswebagency/Greeny/issues


Q. I'm not using the "exp_" naming convention for my DB tables - should I install Greeny?
A. No, not yet. Wait long by the river and a new version will float by that you can use.

Q. Why didn't you call it "GreenEE"
A. Ummmm... well... next question.

Have fun. Hope this little guy makes working with EE2 across multiple environments a little easier.
